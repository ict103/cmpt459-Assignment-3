To run the script, copy and paste the code onto a new script in RGui 
(or any other appropriate compiler). Highlight the section in the 
script that you want to run, then run the script.

Question 1 splits the data into training set (80%) and test set (20%).

Question 2 deals with all of the missing values in both the training
set and the test set by either removing a column, deleting a row, or 
substituting an appropriate value into the missing space.

Question 3 creates a decision tree based on the training data set.

Question 4 finds the optimal size of the decision tree.

Question 5 determines the accuracy of the decision tree prediction 
and calculates the AUC value. The confusion matrix table is displayed
and the ROC curve is plotted.

Question 6 uses the random forest model for 261 trees and  251 trees 
and calculates the accuracy and the AUC values. The ROC curves are 
also plotted.
